- Generate some samples
- GitHub Pages, or ReadMe?
- Generate a release
- Bonus: Circuit analyzer?
    - Read Dia Diagram, build link node network
    - Read source / sink parameters from file
    - Get inputs for unknowns
        - Solar panels on/off
        - Battery charge levels
        - Switch states
    - Get input for sequence info

        - Day/dusk?/night
            - Experiment: solar panel values throughout the day
                - 5:45-ish? cuts from 50kP to 25 kP, and then to 0 kP about an hour later.
                - Although the mouseover sometimes reads 49 or 51 kP, it is always 50 exactly.
                - The solar panel will tell you how much light or dark remains in the day, but the transition happens around 6:00, between the 50->25 and 25->0 transitions.
    - Get initial state
        - Reduce lnn depending on open/close switch state
        - Determine source, sink rate
            - Experiment - what happens to an overloaded line?
                - A line with more load than source (+battery) will act as if the line receives 0kP.
                - An autoswitch with a load behind it that, when the circuit opens, would overload the circuit, will never appear to be green.
            - Experiment - Is an overloaded line affected by autoswitches? (e.g. load -> switch -> overload)
                - YES! A line that would be overloaded if the load behind an autoswitch was connected & is connected to the control line of an autoswitch will oscillate between powering and not powering.
                - State 1: 46kP load on the line, line is ON, autoswitch control line activated
                - State 2: Autoswitch opens.  51kP on the line, line is off, autoswitch control line is deactivated.
                - State 1: Autoswitch closes. 46kP on the line...
            - Experiment: will an overloaded line still charge a battery?
                - NO! After reaching overload, no components on the line will receive power - it is as if the power receives 0kP source.
